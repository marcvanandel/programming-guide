# Programming Guide

Help for my first programming experience. Start with [Work to do?](#work-to-do) and use the [Tools](#tools) section when you need a tool for a task.

## Work to do

1. Create your own [GitHub account](https://github.com/login)
1. Create a new repository: Go to your GitHub profile and select 'New'
   This will be your first program you'll write. Choose a fancy name like 'my-cool-progam'
1. Next step is 'cloning your repo' (repo is short for repository). This will download the online repository in GitHub to your local filesystem
   1. Open the GitHub Desktop
   1. Clone your 'my-cool-program' repo into an easy to find location on your system (e.g. C:\projects)
1. Open your files (in your repo) in VSCode by using the GitHub Desktop button

## Tools

What do I need? (use Ctrl+click to open links)

- Tool #1: [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control of your local files; you'll need this a lot :wink:
  This is a very basic tool ... and because we'll be using GitHub as well (see tool #2) we'll use the GitHub Desktop version of git.
  - Download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - Install with all defaults
  - Check out these instruction videos [part 1](https://youtu.be/9GKpbI1siow) and [part 2](https://youtu.be/n-p1RUmdl9M)

- Tool #2: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) for hosting your files online including the version history of all your files. By doing so you also have a backup of all your files _and_ you can share your changes with others. This is also used to publish your software releases.

- Tool #3: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or Visual Studio Code)
  This is your editor to edit your files. You also will use this for your 'git actions' and synchronization with GitHub

- Tool #4: [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  This is a format to create documentation like this guide. Files have `.md` extension (last part of the filename). In GitHub these Markdown files will be shown as webpages with links and formatting like bulletpoints and headers. Knowing this tool will help you document your own journey in developing your applications.
