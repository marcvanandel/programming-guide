# Programming Guide

Help for my first programming experience.

What do I need?

Tool #1: [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control of your local files; you'll need this a lot :wink:
// TODO find an easy guide for introducing basic git knowledge

Tool #2: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) for hosting your files online including the version history of all your files. By doing so you also have a backup of all your files _and_ you can share your changes with others. This is also used to publish your software releases.
