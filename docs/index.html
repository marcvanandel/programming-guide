            'It depends' is the main response to many questions an IT guy will
            reply. Why? Just ... because it depends. Software and technology are
            layers of technical capabilities and complexity is within each layer
            and multiplied between layers. So the answer to a simple question is
            very often 'it depends. It depends on which layer of the technology
            something arises. It depends if it is on the client side or server
            side (see [client-server](#client-server)). It depends on the error.
            It depends on which specific technology or programming language is
            used. It can depend on so many things! Be prepared to get the
            answer: 'It depends'!

              Source code are just text files. You will need an editor to
              manipulate these text files preferably with support to check that
              instructions are valid for interpretation of the computer. As long
              as the text files are valid the editor does not matter; you're
              free to choose your own. A fully integrated editor which includes
              support for build tools and all kind of error handling during
              development is called a 'Integrated Development Environment' or
              IDE in short. Visual Studio Code is sort of a combination of a
              fairly simple editor and a full IDE.

              Software is written as plain text files. This can not be
              interpreted by computers directly ... most of the times (see [it
              depends](#it-depends)). It is a common pattern that source code
              has to be transformed (compiled) to for computers executable
              software. This transformation contains transforming the text files
              to machine readible files but also contains steps for bundling,
              collecting, downloading dependencies and many, many other steps.
              In general all these steps combined are called 'build' or 'the
              build'. This has to happen before the software can actually be
              executed on a computer. This execution is generally called 'run'.

              The internet connects computers. Each computer can a client. As a
              client this computer is requesting some resource through the
              internet from another computer. The latter is set up as the
              server. A server is just a piece of software that listens to a
              certain port of the computer the software is running on and that
              will respond to requests on that port. So my local laptop or
              desktop computer can be turned into a server by starting a piece
              of software that listens to port 1000 for example. You can use a
              browser as a client by navigating to http://127.0.01:1000. The
              first part is the IP address (internet address) of my local
              computer (also called machine) and after the colon is the port you
              specify the request to, in this case port 1000. DNS is the
              solution to hide the IP address numbers and use proper and names
              easy to remember. Your local machine acts as a local host so this
              request can be written as http://localhost:1000.

              A browser is a special client which also has rich features to run
              code and visualise downloaded resources. In general browsers will
              request HTML resources from servers and this is the basic content
              of a webpage. HTML is the structured content which includes the
              text, links to the images and links to formatting configuration
              like collors and such and also links to JavaScript. These last
              sort are text files which are directly executable by the browser
              to animate the visualisation and do whole a lot of stuff which
              will make the user interface interactive for the user.

            Source code is always the base for a product, a service. The service
            is used by clients and users and uses and produces data. So the
            service has a connection to the database. The data is than being
            used to train an algorithm. Which in turn is used inside or by the
            running service. For example security is mainly focused around the
            service and runtime environment of the service. The code is NOT the
            valid focus for securing this environment. Of course code can open
            up for vulnerabilities ... but it is not the main solution for
            security! All parts can be open ... although the runtime will
            probably the least open. When all (other) parts are open, they
            complement eachother in being open and transparant. It is also
            possible to open up select parts. **Open Data** is common for
            governments. By applying **Open Source** as well the Open Data is
            even more trustworthy. Opening up the algorithms is increasing trust
            in the system as a whole as well. It is also possible to open up the
            algorithms on closed data. Open Source with closed data is possible
            as well. But again, opening up all parts will bring the highest
            level of trust of the system.
